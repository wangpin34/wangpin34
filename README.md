Hi, my name is Penn Wang. 

Mainly programming on the web front end. In 2018, I started working for a team that focuses on k8s resource management and then get touched with technologies other than frontend, including Golang, Docker, ElasticSearch, and a bit of Kubernetes. I even created a CICD service ([Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) as the base) which was written in Golang.

I write at https://github.com/wangpin34/blog and https://dev.to/wangpin34.
