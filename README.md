Hi, my name is Pengson Wang. 

Mainly programming on web frontend. In the beginning, I wrote ReactJS inside Electron base App for the company hardware. In 2018, I started working on the cloud team and learned lots of other technologies other than Web stuff, including Golang, Dockerfile, and even a bit of K8s. But my faviourte always be the web part since I could easily make tools that helps people(may be change my mind someday).

Recently I am making extension for Chrome. They are:
